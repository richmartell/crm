## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you haven't already:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd crm
```

### 2. Configure Environment

The `.env` file should already be configured for Sail. If not, copy the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Start Sail

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
```

This will start all Docker containers (MySQL, Redis, etc.)

### 4. Install Dependencies

If composer dependencies aren't installed:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail composer install
```

Install NPM dependencies:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail npm install
```

### 5. Generate Application Key

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
```

### 6. Run Migrations and Seeders

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate --seed
```

This will create all database tables and populate them with sample data including:
- 5 addresses in various UK cities
- 8 tags (Family, Friends, Work, Rich Uni, Florence School, etc.)
- Sample family with relationships (John & Sarah Smith with children Emma and Oliver)
- University friends (Michael, Lucy)
- Work colleagues (David, Jessica)

### 7. Create Storage Link

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan storage:link
```

This creates a symbolic link for photo uploads.

### 8. Build Frontend Assets

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev
```

For production:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail npm run build
```

### 9. Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost
```

Tag::create([
    'name' => 'Your Tag Name',
    'color' => '#hex-color',
]);
```

### Adding New Relationship Types

Relationship types are stored as strings. Common types:
- spouse
- child
- parent
- sibling
- friend
- colleague
- neighbor

You can use any custom relationship type when creating relationships.

### Customizing Colors

The application uses Tailwind CSS. To customize colors, edit:

```bash
tailwind.config.js
```

### Flux UI Pro

If you have a Flux UI Pro license, you can upgrade by adding your authentication to `composer.json`:

```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "composer",
        "url": "https://composer.fluxui.dev"
    }
],
"require": {
    "livewire/flux-pro": "^1.0"
}
```

Then run:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail composer update
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission issues:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan storage:link
sudo chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER storage bootstrap/cache
```

### Database Connection

If you can't connect to the database:

1. Ensure Sail is running: `./vendor/bin/sail ps`
2. Check your `.env` file has correct database credentials
3. Try: `./vendor/bin/sail down` then `./vendor/bin/sail up -d`

### Assets Not Loading

If CSS/JS assets aren't loading:

1. Make sure Vite is running: `./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev`
2. Check the browser console for errors
3. Try rebuilding: `./vendor/bin/sail npm run build`
