## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you haven't already:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd crm
```

### 2. Configure Environment

The `.env` file should already be configured for Sail. If not, copy the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Start Sail

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
```

This will start all Docker containers (MySQL, Redis, etc.)

### 4. Install Dependencies

If composer dependencies aren't installed:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail composer install
```

Install NPM dependencies:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail npm install
```

### 5. Generate Application Key

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
```

### 6. Run Migrations and Seeders

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate --seed
```

This will create all database tables and populate them with sample data including:
- 5 addresses in various UK cities
- 8 tags (Family, Friends, Work, Rich Uni, Florence School, etc.)
- Sample family with relationships (John & Sarah Smith with children Emma and Oliver)
- University friends (Michael, Lucy)
- Work colleagues (David, Jessica)

### 7. Create Storage Link

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan storage:link
```

This creates a symbolic link for photo uploads.

### 8. Build Frontend Assets

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev
```

For production:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail npm run build
```

### 9. Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost
```

]);
```

### Adding New Relationship Types

Relationship types are stored as strings. Common types:
- spouse
- child
- parent
- sibling
- friend
- colleague
- neighbor

You can use any custom relationship type when creating relationships.

### Customizing Colors

The application uses Tailwind CSS. To customize colors, edit:

```bash
tailwind.config.js
```

### Flux UI Pro

If you have a Flux UI Pro license, you can upgrade by adding your authentication to `composer.json`:

```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "composer",
        "url": "https://composer.fluxui.dev"
    }
],
"require": {
    "livewire/flux-pro": "^1.0"
}
```

Then run:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail composer update
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission issues:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan storage:link
sudo chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER storage bootstrap/cache
```

### Database Connection

If you can't connect to the database:

1. Ensure Sail is running: `./vendor/bin/sail ps`
2. Check your `.env` file has correct database credentials
3. Try: `./vendor/bin/sail down` then `./vendor/bin/sail up -d`

### Assets Not Loading

If CSS/JS assets aren't loading:

1. Make sure Vite is running: `./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev`
2. Check the browser console for errors
3. Try rebuilding: `./vendor/bin/sail npm run build`

## Authentication & Two-Factor Login

- Login and registration provided by Laravel Breeze + Livewire
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) powered by Google Authenticator
- 2FA setup page available under **Settings → Two-Factor Authentication**
- After enabling 2FA you must enter a 6-digit code from your authenticator app when signing in
- If you lose access to your authenticator app, disable 2FA from the settings page while signed in

### Test Accounts

| Email               | Password  | 2FA Enabled |
|---------------------|-----------|-------------|
| `john@example.com`  | `password`| Disabled    |
| `jane@example.com`  | `password`| Disabled    |

You can enable 2FA on either account from the settings page.

## Contact Visibility Rules

- Every contact belongs to the user who created it
- When creating or editing a contact you can toggle **Share this contact with other users**
- **Personal contacts** (`is_shared = false`) are visible only to the owner
- **Shared contacts** (`is_shared = true`) are visible to all authenticated users
- Only the owner of a contact can edit or delete it (even if it is shared)

### Example Scenarios

- John creates a personal contact → only John can view and edit it
- John creates a shared contact → Jane can view the contact but only John can edit it
- Jane enables 2FA → she must provide the code from her authenticator app on next login
